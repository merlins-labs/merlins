In upcoming year (2023), team target is to migrate on Gnolang smartcontracts, allowing to build smartcontracts in Go, with a robust and radically transparent approach. </h3>

> **Warning**: Merlins is still under active alpha development and not audited yet. The dApp should be used very carefuly.

npx expo start
```

Then press `w` to open the page in your browser

### Dev for desktop

```
npx expo-electron start
```

### Build web app

```
npx expo-optimize && npx expo build:web
```

The site is in `web-build/`

### Build desktop apps

```
yarn && yarn electron-webpack && yarn electron-builder --arm64 --x64 -mwl --dir -c.compression=store -c.mac.identity=null
```

The apps are in `dist/`

## Introduction

> **Warning**: Merlins is still under active development and should be used carefuly, with a Beta tester approach.

**[Merlins dApp](https://www.merlins.world/)** is a all-in-one application providing various coordination & communication features for humans. 
In the future (v3) it will also be a privacy first messaging application built on top of [the Berty Protocol](https://berty.tech/docs/protocol/).

- *Genesis Era - Alpha (Web only)* :
    - Multichain NFT Marketplace v0.1 (Merlins Network first)
    - Staking $FURY Tokens 
    - Merlins Chain Governance (& Bounty Program)

On this Genesis Era, core team will gather various tools, dapps, and open source code from most serious Cosmos contributors, in a Merlins User Experience, to onboard new users into the state of the art. Team is at the same time paralelizing its development and re-building this 'state of the art' code using Gnolang. This allow merlins-core team #1 to both start shipping tools quickly to community and prepare the future proof approach with a deep state of the art expertise.

**Merlins** is designed to be managed by community, with a step by step strategy allowing to empower the user:

- Vote on upcoming launches of the Launchpad (The R!OT)
- Vote on upcoming Premium features
- Vote on Bounties Allocations
- Vote on every new proposals provided by community 
- Users are not simply passive users, but are incentived to participate. Let's make governance great again.

Merlins is currently launched by a distributed core team, bootstrapping the network & dApp development, with the mission to make it governed by users, developped by more and more builders from all ecosystems. 
A dedicated Grants program, a Bounties program, are currently prepared by the core team to allow external contributors to join us.
