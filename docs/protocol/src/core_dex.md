# Decentralized Exchange

Merlins is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) protocol built using Cosmos SDK that represents a flexible building block for programmable liquidity.

By separating the AMM curve logic and math from the core swapping functionality, Merlins becomes an extensible AMM that can incorporate any number of swap curves and pool types. This includes:

- Traditional 50/50  weighted pools
- Custom weights like 80/20 for controlled exposure
- Solidly-style Stableswap curve
- Concentrated Liquidity pools
- CosmWasm pools
